# Introduction

This shader can be used for simple shading of the model, and the shading method uses the Blinn-Phong Reflectance Model


# Requirements

You don't need to configure any libraries or dependencies, just move all the files in the DLL file to your workspace directory.And then click exe file. You will find a colorful calf. Model files and texture files are pre-prepared. You can also use other models or textures if you like.

# Usage

- Normal Shader(Default)

```
.\Rasterizer.exe normal
```
- Phong Shader

```
.\Rasterizer.exe phong
```
- Texture Shader

```
.\Rasterizer.exe texture
```

- Bump Shader
```
.\Rasterizer.exe bump
```

- Displament Map
```
.\Rasterizer.exe displacement
```

- Press **A**:rotate the model to the left
- Press **D**:rotate the model to the right
